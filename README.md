# python-input-validation
## overview
This is a simple Python script that asks yhe user to enter a number, validates the input, converts it to the correct number type(integer or float), and calculates the square root.
It's designed to practice Python basics such as:
. Loops(`while`)
. Exception handling (`try/except`)
. Type conversion (`float` and `int`)
. Using the `math` library

## How to Use
1. Run the script using Python3.
2. The program will ask you to enter a number.
3. If the input is invalid (not a number), it will keep asking.
4. Once a valid number is entered, the script prints its square root.

## Key Learning Points
- Handling user input safely
- Understanding that `input()` always return a string
- Converting strings to numbers for calculations
- Checking for whole numbers to print clean output
